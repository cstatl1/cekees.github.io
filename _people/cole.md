I am a graduate student in Civil & Enviornmental Engineering working towards a Master's degree in the Coastal Engineering program. My research involves computational modeling of water waves, fluid-structure interactions, as well as coastal morphodynamics. 

I was born and raised in Sussex County, Delaware, and spent my summers lifeguarding in Bethany Beach, Delaware. I attended the University of Delaware (UD), where I received my Bachelors of Civil Engineering degree in May of 2023. I worked with mulitiple professors in the Coastal Engineering department at UD as an undergraduate researcher prior to starting at LSU in August of 2023.
